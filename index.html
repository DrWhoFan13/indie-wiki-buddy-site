                Indie Wiki Buddy is a browser extension that helps you easily find and support independent wikis you
                might otherwise miss in search results.
                <br />
                <br />
                When you visit a wiki on a large, corporate-run site, this extension will notify or automatically
                redirect you to quality independent wikis when they're available. Search results in Google, Bing, and
                DuckDuckGo can also be filtered, replacing non-independent wikis with text inviting you to visit the
                independent counterpart.
                <br />
                <br />
                And you're in full control -- you can choose your experience wiki-by-wiki!
                <br />
                <br />
                Indie Wiki Buddy also supports <a href="https://breezewiki.com/">BreezeWiki</a>, a service that renders
                Fandom wikis without ads or bloat. This helps give you a more enjoyable reading experience when an
                independent wiki isn't available!
            </div>
            <br />
            <img
                src="./img/indie-wiki-buddy-screenshot.png"
                width="400"
                alt="A screenshot of the Indie Wiki Buddy settings screen"

        <div class="container content">
            <h2 class="subtitle">Guide</h2>
            <div class="content">
                Once installed, you can access the extension settings via the
                <img src="./img/logo.png" width="20" alt="icon of an arrow pointing to the right" />
                in the top bar.
                <br />
                The language dropdown at the right lets you switch between wikis in different languages. <br />
                There are also several toggles available:
                <ul class="no-markers">
                    <li>
                        <img src="./img/power-on.png" width="25" alt="" /> The power button turns the extension on and
                        off.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <img src="./img/bell-on.png" width="25" alt="" /> The notify-on-redirect option will send you a
                        desktop notification when you have been redirected to an independent wiki.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <img src="./img/check-on.png" width="25" alt="" /> The BreezeWiki option will render Fandom
                        wikis through <a href="https://breezewiki.com/" target="_blank">BreezeWiki</a>, an external
                        service that removes clutter, simplifies the page, and removes ads. When enabled, you will see a
                        list of available BreezeWiki mirrors. Occaisionally, BreezeWiki or one of its mirrors may go
                        down; when this happens, you can simply switch to another working instance.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The list of all wikis allows you to configure what you want to happen when visiting the respective
                non-independent wiki:
                <ul class="no-markers">
                    <li>
                        <img src="./img/toggle-disabled.png" width="20" alt="" /> Disable: You will be neither notified
                        of nor redirected to the independent counterpart. You will still be directed to BreezeWiki if it
                        is turned on.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <img src="./img/toggle-redirect.png" width="20" alt="" /> Redirect: Be automatically redirected
                        to the independent counterpart.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <img src="./img/toggle-alert.png" width="20" alt="" /> Alert: Have a display banner at the top
                        notifying you that an independent wiki is available. This will appear on both Fandom and
                        BreezeWiki pages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <img src="./img/toggle-search-filter.png" width="20" alt="" />
                        Search filtering: Replace search results in Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo with text inviting you
                        to visit the independent wiki. Oftentimes, the non-independent wiki should appear in that same
                        search.

                We're always looking for more wikis to add to the extension! <br />
                <br />
                Here are the criteria:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The destination wiki should be independent, meaning that decisioning and control of the wiki
                        largely rests with the wiki's staff and volunteer editing community.
                    </li>
                    <li class="indent">
                        Factors include editorial independence, the editorbase's ability to request changes from their
                        host, and any history of the host exerting decisions contrary to a wiki community's wishes.
                    </li>
                    <li class="indent">
                        Miraheze wikis may be considered independent, due to Miraheze's openness, customizability, and
                        ability for wikis to migrate off the platform.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The destination wiki should be of decent quality, ideally matching (or exceeding) the quality
                        and size of the origin wiki. While we want to support all independent wikis, we also want
                        extension users to be directed to wikis where they can find what they are looking for.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When there are multiple independent wikis on the same subject, we will usually point to the wiki
                        that is most complete and prominent in the community.
                    </li>

            <div class="content">
                Large, corporate-run wiki farms have enabled hundreds of great wikis and communities. Unfortunately,
                these wiki farms can easily overshadow quality independent wikis, especially in search engine results.
                Independent wikis often have the benefit of greater self-determination and fewer ads, but are easily
                missed by users who aren't aware of their existence. This extension aims to help wiki readers discover
                and user quality, independent wikis.
            </div>
            <br /><br />
            <span class="question"
                >For independent wikis to be added to the extension, why do they need to be of equal quality and
                coverage as its non-independent counterpart?</span
            >
            <div class="content">
                The extension is geared towards readers looking for information, and pointing them towards wikis that
                might not have the information they're seeking isn't an ideal experience.
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                That being said, I do want to support all independent wikis and know the importance for developing wikis
                to get new readers and editors. In the future, the extension may allow for less-complete wikis to be
                added, though likely with some sort of control to allow users to easily filter/toggle these wikis.
