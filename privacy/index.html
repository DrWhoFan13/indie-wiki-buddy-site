            <p>
                This website is hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub's privacy policy is available
                <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement">here</a>.
                <br /><br />
                The Indie Wiki Buddy browser extension links to and redirects users to external, third-party websites
                not controlled by the extension. These websites have their own privacy policies and practices. Users
                should visit these websites at their own risk.
                <br /><br />
                The Indie Wiki Buddy browser extension does not collect or transmit any information about you. The
                extension's settings are stored locally in your browser and/or in your browser's sync feature, if
                supported.
                <br /><br />
                If the BreezeWiki redirect functionality has been enabled, the extension will pull a list of working
                BreezeWiki instances from
                <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KevinPayravi/breezewiki-instances/main/instances.json">
                a file hosted on GitHub</a>, managed by the Indie Wiki Buddy developer. This is done in order to provide
                the extension with an update-to-date list of working BreezeWiki mirrors.
                <br /><br />
                Your browser and the online store you acquire the extension through (e.g.
                <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions">Chrome Web Store</a> or
                <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/extensions/">Firefox Add-ons</a>) may perform its own
                data collection.
